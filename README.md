# TTV-to-TLS
A simple extension created to redirect Twitch URLs to their respective TwitchLS equivalents for an ad-free viewing experience.<br/>
To use this extension, right click on a Twitch stream, before an ad starts to play or at any point and select 'Open with TwitchLS'.<br/>
Using 'Open with TwitchLS' on the Twitch homepage will redirect you to TwitchLS's homepage.<br/>
THIS IS NOT AN ADBLOCK, IT IS AN ALTERNATIVE IF YOUR ADBLOCK/ADBLOCKING IN GENERAL STOPS WORKING ON TWITCH<br/><br/>

Made by Jon_TriHard and Pentalex.


No longer works as TLS now has the AD detection screen. Sadge.
